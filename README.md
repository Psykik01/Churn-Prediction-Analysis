# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using a Random Forest classifier. It walks through the full data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning model training, evaluation, and visualization. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave so the business can take proactive steps to retain them.
